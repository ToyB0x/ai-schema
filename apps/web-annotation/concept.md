# A Platform for Safely Promoting AI-Driven Development

## Introduction

In recent years, development methods utilizing AI have rapidly proliferated. Particularly with techniques like "Vibe Coding," a new development paradigm is emerging where developers give high-level instructions to AI, and AI generates the code. While this AI-driven development offers overwhelming productivity gains compared to traditional methods, the possibility of AI making mistakes cannot be denied. ai-schema is a platform that provides guardrails and schema definitions to safely and efficiently promote such AI-driven development.

## What is ai-schema?

ai-schema is a platform that provides guardrails and schema definitions to safely promote AI-driven development. Especially in front-end development, it ensures safety even if AI makes mistakes and promotes collaboration between developers and AI.

::: tip Key Point
**Tolerate AI mistakes while ensuring safety.** In AI-driven development, overall productivity improvement is crucial, even if AI makes minor mistakes. Particularly in the UI domain, where rapid development is often prioritized over strict accuracy, ai-schema provides guardrails to prevent critical issues while tolerating minor AI errors.

## The Importance of Guardrails in AI-Driven Development

Guardrails are crucial in AI-driven development, especially in the front-end domain, for the following reasons:

### Ensuring Safety While Tolerating AI Mistakes

AI is a powerful tool, but it's not perfect. Especially in the UI domain, improving overall development speed is often more important than minor imperfections. ai-schema provides guardrails to ensure that even if AI makes mistakes, they don't lead to critical problems.

::: info What are acceptable mistakes?
Minor visual discrepancies in the UI, temporary non-critical feature glitches, etc., that don't significantly impact the user experience can be tolerated. On the other hand, data loss, security vulnerabilities, and critical feature failures must be prevented.

### Guidance Through Schema Definitions

Providing appropriate guidance to AI can improve the quality of its output. ai-schema utilizes standard schema definitions like GraphQL schemas and OpenAPI to provide clear guidelines to AI.

### Integration with Backend Services

In front-end development, integration with backend services is essential. ai-schema integrates with backend services like GraphQL and OpenAI API to ensure consistency between the front-end and backend.

::: warning Caution
Schema definitions need thorough consideration in the early stages of development. Inappropriate schema definitions can cause significant problems later in the development process.

## Comparison of Traditional and AI-Driven Development

Comparing traditional development methods with AI-driven development reveals the following differences:

| Aspect | Traditional Development | AI-Driven Development |
|------|------------|---------|
| Development Speed | Depends on developer skill and experience | Significantly improved with AI assistance |
| Quality Management | Strict testing and reviews | Safety ensured by guardrails and schema definitions |
| Flexibility | Takes time to respond to changes | Rapid changes and adaptation possible |
| Learning Curve | Takes time to learn new technologies | Shortened with AI assistance |
| Error Handling | Focuses on preventing errors | Tolerates errors while ensuring safety |

## Guardrails with GraphQL and OpenAI

ai-schema provides guardrails utilizing GraphQL and the OpenAI API:

### Guardrails with GraphQL Schema

GraphQL schemas clearly define the interface between the front-end and backend. This ensures that the code generated by AI is always compatible with the backend.

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  role: UserRole!
}

enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  USER
  GUEST
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  users: [User!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!, email: String!, role: UserRole!): User!
  updateUser(id: ID!, name: String, email: String, role: UserRole): User!
  deleteUser(id: ID!): Boolean!
}
```

### Guardrails with OpenAI API

Utilizing the OpenAI API allows for safe validation of user input and content generation. ai-schema provides an interface to easily integrate with the OpenAI API.

::: info Example of OpenAI API Usage
```typescript
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// Validate user input
async function validateUserInput(input: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: 'You are an assistant that validates user input.' },
      { role: 'user', content: `Determine if the following input is safe: ${input}` }
    ],
    temperature: 0,
  });
  
  return response.choices[0].message.content?.toLowerCase().includes('safe') ?? false;
}
```
