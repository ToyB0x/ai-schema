# The Future of Documentation is Rule-Driven

ai-schema bridges the gap between AI capabilities and human documentation standards. Instead of adapting to how AI writes, define your rules and watch AI conform to your standards.

## Overview

ai-schema is an experimental project exploring AI capabilities for document linting. It provides a flexible framework for defining and enforcing documentation standards through a rule-based system. The tool integrates with AI platforms like Cline and other AI coding tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

```bash
# Quick installation
git clone https://github.com/ToyB0x/ai-schema.git
cd ai-schema
pnpm install && pnpm build
```

::: code-group

```json [Configuration]
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@ai-schema/mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/PATH/TO/YOUR_DIR/ai-schema/apps/mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

```markdown [Usage]
You (AI assistants like Cline or Roo Code) must follow these important rules:

- Verify that the MCP Server @ai-schema/mcp is properly set up
- If not set up correctly, inform the user "The @ai-schema/mcp configuration is incorrect" and halt all subsequent processing
- If set up correctly, execute @ai-schema/mcp's load-remote-act-rule and apply the following rules
```

```markdown [Rules]
# Technical Term Consistency Rule

## Purpose
- Ensure consistent use of technical terms
- Prevent confusion from terminology variations

## Rule
Technical terms must be used consistently throughout the document.
```
